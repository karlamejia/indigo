<p>I'm a researcher and data scientist at MIT.</p>

<p>I've always been fascinated with making sense of the world. I studied philosophy, economics, and mathematics at The University of Texas in Austin in my quest to learn the secret sauce for understanding the world. After graduating, I dabbled in software development and learned the hell outta SQL as a technical consultant at Quorum Software and then as a data analyst at Comlinkdata.</p>

<p>There's nothing like working with messy data in the real world to make you painfully aware of your limited understanding of statistics. So, I decided to rectify the situation by getting an MS in biostatistics from Harvard where I wrote my master's thesis on using Google Searches to predict flu outbreaks in African countries. </p>
