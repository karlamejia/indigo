I decided to start learning about deep learning because I'd like to be able to understand what the deep learning people I work with are doing. I'm going to use this
blog to document my thoughts as I go through the Deep Learning textbook by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. I've only looked at the intro so far,
and it has already clarified a lot of terms that are frequently thrown around by the deep learning crew at work.
